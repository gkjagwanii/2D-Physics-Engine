# 2D Physics Engine
A graphics engine to simulate 2D physics.

## Goal
This project is mainly to improve my skills in C++
and learning OpenGL to manipulate the GPU.

## Primary Functionalities
- Positional and movement logic.(To do)
- Rigid Body Physics.(To do)
- Collision Detection.(To do)
- Collision Resolution.(To do)

## Going Forward
My plans are to have an iterative approach and keep working with Graphic APIs until I have a 
quality Game Engine that can produce good quality games and other forms of interactive media.
