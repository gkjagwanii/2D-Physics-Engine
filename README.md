# 2D Physics Engine
A graphics engine to simulate molecules in different states of matter.
Currently under active development.

## Goal
This project is mainly to improve my skills in C++
and learning OpenGL to manipulate the GPU.

## Primary Functionalities
- Positional and movement logic.(To do)
- Rigid Body Physics.(To do)
- Collision Detection.(To do)
- Collision Resolution.(To do)
- Gravity.(To do)
- Intermolecular force/attraction?(To do)

## Going Forward
I plan to have an iterative approach and will keep working with Graphics APIs until I have a 
quality Game Engine that can produce good quality games and other forms of interactive media.
